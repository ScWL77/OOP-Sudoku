# Overview

IM1003 Object-Oriented Programming Mini Project

We were tasked with building a Sudoku game on Eclipse based on the basic template that was given. From there, we had to implement additional features to the game to improve it. Java OOP and GUI (AWT, Swing) were mainly used to design the game.

# Features Added
- Welcome Page
- Reset or Restart the game
- Choice of puzzles and difficulty levels (e.g., easy, intermediate, difficult)
- Timer (pause/resume), score, progress bar
- Automatic puzzle generation with various difficulty levels
- Sound effects, background music, enable/disable sound
- Hints and cheats (reveal a random cell)
